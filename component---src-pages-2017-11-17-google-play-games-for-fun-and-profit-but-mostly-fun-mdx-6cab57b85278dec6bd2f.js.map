The need for this app was borne out of the fact that my partner - who teaches ESL (English as a second language) to overseas students, wanting to have something visual that her students could refer to. Now, as any dictionary goes - it can be quite dry. So, to make the app more engaging we gamified it!`}</p>\n      <p>{`One of my favourite word games is Hangman, so I figured I'd try and implement it for this app.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Conceptually, the game is really simple. A player gets a few chances to guess a word or a phrase (in this case, Australian Slang). The player of course gets given a hint that can aide in guessing said word and phrase. Points get awarded if the user is able to successfully guess the word or phrase - however, in my version of the game points also get taken away for each wrong guess. Users get 9 guesses in total, per word or phrase.`}</p>\n      <p>{`But there was still something missing. I wanted to implement a social aspect to the game - so as to increase user engagement. If you aren't playing for an achievement, for example, a game can quickly get boring! Also, a backend implementation can quickly get quick complicated - namely, you need to define a user identity and ensure there is some form of authorization. Then you award points per guessed word, and write a way to quantify how a user's performance compares to another's. Enter Google Play Games services.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Google Play provides some really cool facilities out of the box for Game developers.

Users can create a Games Profile - an account that persists and saves their games data. It also introduces a social aspect wherein, users can add other users as friends. Games generally need to implement a points system i.e. a \"unit\" they award a user for carrying out a particular action successfully. This is the metric a game developer can use to place users a Leaderboard. It is also the same metric that can be used to level users up when they reach and progress through amounts of it, assigned to them.`}</p>\n      <p align=\"center\">\n        <img src={play_games_app} width=\"30%\" />\n      </p>\n      <h1>{`That's enough theory, how do I implement it?!`}</h1>\n      <p>{`You start with creating a Game on Google play developer console.

Basically, you need to implemement a \"points\" metric - something you reward the user when they carry a certain action. Then determine appropriate times in the user's gaming lifecycle to call the Leaderboards API and post the user's current points. That's it! To add a leaderboard, in the Play Console, under Games Services, just click on \"Add a Leaderboard\", give it a name for example. World Rankings, and then determine if larger points or smaller points is better. You can also define a limit i.e. not to award points above a certain limit. Note, every Leaderboard creates a leaderboard_id String. This needs to be added as a @StringRes String so we can reference it later!`}</p>\n      <p align=\"center\">\n        <img src={leaderboards} width=\"30%\" />\n      </p>\n      <p>{`Configuring Achievements is even simpler. As I said previously, these are \"level ups\" for players. What is unique is, that as the play levels up in your game, Play games also levels them up in \"XP\", in that particular game's category! Achievements are quantified in terms of the points metric we spoke about previously. So, achievement-1 could be awarded when a user scores 50 points, achievement-2 awarded when a user scores 100 etc. To configure achievements, on Games services, just click on just click on “Add achievement”, give it an icon, description, XP points, whether it is visible to the user. Note, every achievement creates an achievement_id String. This needs to be added as a @StringRes String so we can reference it later!`}</p>\n      <p align=\"center\">\n        <img src={achievements} width=\"30%\" />\n      </p>\n      <p>{`Now let's get back to the code!

When the onConnectionFailed() callback comes back, it has a ConnectionResult object. We can query it to see if it returns true for hasResolution() and if so, we run the startResolutionForResult() method on it and pass in an arbitrary integer, very similarly to startActivityForResult() in Android.
