# Does this even work?

Well it certainly seems to work. This is my first post on this static site and I tell you what, I am going to try and document how I got here.


- Edited my custom domain's DNS Apex and WWW A records to my github pages page.

- Needed to remove all of my custom domain's DNS settings for the Apex and WWW A records.

- Needed to create a CNAME file for github pages - well jekyll.

- Needed to edit the github pages repo site to use my custom domain name.


Phew. At least it's done. Now lets build some other stuff eh.
