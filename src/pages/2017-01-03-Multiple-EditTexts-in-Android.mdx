# Multiple EditTexts in Android

Often times there is a necessity for an app to display multiple EditText inputs. For example, lets take a look at this screen in my application Orderise (since been unpublished)

<p align="center">
<img src = { three } width="30%" />;
</p>

There are two EditText input boxes namely, a special_orders and a name box.

It is possible to have a single TextWatcher for multiple EditTexts, like so:

    ```
    //first define each EditText
    EditText nameText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.name);
    EditText specialOrders = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.special_instructions);

    //Next add textwatchers for each editText. You will need to get the activity or fragment that contains them to implement TextWatcher
    nameText.addTextChangedListener(this);
    special_orders.addTextChangedListener(this);

    ```

Now, this is where it gets interesting. You see, if this were multiple Buttons for a single OnClickListener, it would be easy as pie - just get the activity to implement the OnClickListener and then look for each Button's Id to be able to detect which button was clicked. Something like:

    Button button1 = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button1);
    Button button2 = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button2);
    button1.setOnClickListener(this);
    button2.setOnClickListener(this);

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        switch (v.getId()) {
            case R.id.button1: {
                //do something useful here.
                }
            case R.id.button2: {
                //do something else useful here.
                break;
            }
          }

But unfortunately, with TextWatcher we do not have the luxury of the the View object being passed into the Overridden methods of beforeTextChanged, onTextChanged and afterTextChanged. But there is still a way. For example, in the afterTextChanged method, we can compare the hashCode for the Editable Object with the Text in the EditText object, like so:

    @Override
    public void afterTextChanged(Editable s) {
      if (s.hashCode() == nameText.getText().hashCode()) {
          //Do else something with input.
      } else if (s.hashCode() == specialOrders.getText().hashCode()) {
          //Do something else useful with input.
      }
    }

There are of course a few other ways - one is to subclass the EditText Class and then pass the EditText View object into the three methods. But I believe the solution above is a bit more elegant.
